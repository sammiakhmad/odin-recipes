    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>This satay recipe is the main course-size version of a fabulous Thai appetizer: strips of beef marinated in Asian spices, skewered, and grilled for a truly amazing combination of flavors. With grilling season still in full swing, you can never have enough new and exciting ways to enjoy beef. Serve with my peanut dipping sauce.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 2-inch piece of fresh lemon grass (white part only)</li>
        <li>2 pounds beef top sirloin, trimmed</li>
        <li>4 12-inch long metal skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic, onion, oil, soy sauce, coriander, ginger, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Bruise lemongrass by hitting it lightly several times with the back of a large chef's knife; mince lemongrass and add to marinade.</li>
        <li>Cut beef sirloin into strips about 2 1/2-inches long and 1/8 inch-thick. Stir beef into marinade until beef is completely coated, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove beef from marinade and shake off excess marinade. Thread 1/4 of the meat onto each metal skewer. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Arrange skewers on the preheated grill; cook until meat stops sticking to the grill, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip skewers and continue cooking until meat is well browned and shows grill marks, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Flip skewers once more; cook until meat is still slightly pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer skewers to a platter; let rest for 2 minutes before serving.</li>
